# Frontend Developer :computer:
I am a Telecommunications and Electronics Engineer working in the programming field. I spent about two years learning and doing personal projects before my first job as a Frontend Developer; currently I've been in that position for almost two years and counting. Furthermore, I can maintain, update or create modern web applications, plan their architecture, apply best practices, propose creative solutions, maintain communication with the team and ensure that the code is scalable, maintainable and reusable. Always friendly, smiling, focused and perseverant; learning every day and looking to give the best of me.
